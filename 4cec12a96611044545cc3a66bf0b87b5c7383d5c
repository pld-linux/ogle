- Version: 0.7.1
- libraries moved back to %{_libdir}/ogle/. These are private ogle libraries,
  used only by ogle, they should not trash %{_libdir}
- remove acinclude.m4 as this is a (broken) copy of libtool.m4 which is added by aclocal
- hack to install libdvdcontrol library which is not installed by default (I don't know why)
